# Project Concord
*A community platform for on-demand volunteering.*

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to the `lib/` directory.

### Using VS Code
Since not all developers are using VS Code, we must ensure that .vscode/ does not
get checked into the source code. To do this:

- Delete the folder on your local machine
- Commit the change
- Update `.gitignore` to exclude `.vscode/`
- Commit that change
- Undo the file deletion

## Contributors
